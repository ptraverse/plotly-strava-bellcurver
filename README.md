Plotly Strava Bellcurver
========================

Strava's leaderboards show rank within a set, but sometimes a picture is better. This project allows you to show how a histogram (aka bell curve) of other efforts on the same segment as the input effort.

# Outline

For any list of efforts I want:

* Drawing as a bell curve
* Calc of std dev (x-axis scale)
* Average (mean)
* Y-axis scale (histogram)

# Dev Env

# t0d0s

* Add optional filters (start_date, end_date, athlete_id)
* Reactify ?
* Tests ?
* FrontEnd beautification

none of the todos will ever get done.
